## This is Hard and That's Ok

--

<p class="large">It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.”</p> 

--

<p class="large">But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time.</p>

--

<p class="large">Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.</p>
